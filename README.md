This is the *AI Diet   Meal Planner* project I made myself.


<p>We all love a well-cooked home meal, but the choice of what to prepare is the actual challenge — especially when you are short on time, ingredients, or ideas of what to have. What if you had an AI sous-chef of your own? You will develop a<strong> </strong>multi-agent AI system using FastAPI where each agent plays a role in designing the perfect recipe depending on what you have in your kitchen and your nutritional needs. You’ll create agents that analyze available ingredients, filter recipes by diet type, and plan a complete step-by-step meal—with structured JSON outputs from LLMs.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/530?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/530</a>
